## Installation
Ensure that Node.JS version 6.x or higher is installed.

Grab the software:
* Via git (preferred): ```git clone https://github.com/pluggemi/roon-web-controller.git```
* Or download and extract the zip file.

Change directory into the software:
```cd roon-web-controller```

Install the Node.JS modules
```npm install```

Run the application:
```node app.js```

On an existing Roon client, go to "Settings" then "Extensions". Click "Enable" beside "Web Controller".

Open a web browser to your server at either "http://localhost:8080" or "http://(IP of Device):8080".

### (Optional) Local configuration file
Simply copy `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` to `config/local.conf` and edit `config/local.conf` as needed.
* `config/local.conf` is not tracked by `git`, so it will not be clobbered with updates
* `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` is tracked by `git` and will be updated in the future as new options are available

Content of `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE`

```
// Copy this file to "local.json" and change the port as desired.
{
  "server": {

### (Optional) Sample systemd unit file
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is the init system used by modern Linux systems.  Here is a sample systemd unit file which can be used to automatically start this application at Linux system boot time.
```
[Unit]
Description=NodeJS app - Roon Web Controller
After=network.target

[Service]
User=node
WorkingDirectory=/srv/node/roon-web-controller
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
#### Usage
To use this unit file:
* Save this template to a file called ```roon-web-controller.service```
* Edit the ```user``` field to be the user running the application
* Edit the ```WorkingDirectory``` field to be the location where the application is installed (**NOTE**: the ```user``` must have read and write access to this location!)
* Using either ```sudo``` or as ```root```, copy the edited ```roon-web-controller.service``` file to ```/usr/lib/systemd/system```
* Reload systemd: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
* Start the application: ```sudo systemctl start roon-web-controller.service```
* Enable the application at boot up: ```sudo systemctl enable roon-web-controller.service```

You can monitor the output of this application using ```journalctl```.
* To show the application output: ```sudo journalctl -u roon-web-controller```
* To follow the application output: ```sudo journalctl -f -u roon-web-controller```
